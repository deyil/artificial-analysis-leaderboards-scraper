# Implementation Tasks

## Task List

- [x] Explore the target website structure to understand data format and layout
- [x] Design the project structure and core components
- [x] Create the specs/architecture.md document with detailed technical specifications
- [x] Review and finalize the architecture document
- [x] Install dependencies from requirements.txt
- [x] Run tests to verify functionality
- [x] Test main script execution

## Test Results

### Dependency Installation
- All dependencies from requirements.txt were successfully installed:
  - requests (2.32.4)
  - beautifulsoup4 (4.13.4)
  - PyYAML (6.0.2)
- No issues encountered during installation

### Test Execution
- Tests were run but no tests were collected
- Both test files exist but contain only placeholder content with TODO comments
- No actual test implementations were found

### Main Script Execution
- Main script now runs without ModuleNotFoundError
- Script encounters a new issue where no table is found in the HTML content
- Error message: "No table found in HTML content"
- Error occurs in the parsing logic when trying to extract leaderboard data

## Current TODO List

- [x] Read the current content of specs/tasks.md
- [x] Update content with dependency installation results
- [x] Update content with test results
- [x] Update content with main script error information
- [x] Mirror the checklist from the TODO list
- [x] Write updated content back to specs/tasks.md


# Mirrored TODO checklist

- [x] Review current parser and scraper code to locate provider extraction logic in [`src/components/parser.py`](src/components/parser.py:1) and [`src/components/scraper.py`](src/components/scraper.py:1)
- [x] Implement provider name extraction so the scraper uses the image <img> alt text if present, otherwise falls back to the image filename (without extension) when populating the "API Provider" CSV column
- [x] Update CSV writer (if separate) to populate the "API Provider" column with the extracted provider name
- [x] Run the test suite and fix any failing tests related to parsing/formatting
- [-] Mirror this checklist into [`specs/tasks.md`](specs/tasks.md:1)
